# cs348Project
This project is built by Yufei Qiu.
This project demonstrates the database storage and usage in react application.

There are not many restrictions on viewing and changing the database for demonstrative purpose. This project only serves as a outlook of what I have learnt and achieved with SQL.
Postgres and express are used to this project to build and run the backend function calls.

This project consists of three pages: teacher, student, and quiz page. Things are kept simple for solely for viewing purposes.

There are two roles in this application: admistrator, teacher, and student.
Teacher can:
view enrolled students, 
view, create, edit, delete, assign quizzes

Students can:
view unattempted/attempted quizzes.

Admistrator can:
Create/Delete Teachers,
Create/Delete Students,
View all teacher/students/quizzes data.
